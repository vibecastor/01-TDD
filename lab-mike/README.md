# node-modules
**Author**: Mike Castor
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
- For this project we needed to initialize our files to run in node.js in order to allow testing using jest and linting using airbnb style guide.
- This project also offered an opportunity to practice building ES6 style functions and CommonJS module patterns.
- The Greet module exports a string with a single airty of "name".  The module should output a greeting, "Hello, name!".  If the output data does not resolve to string the module will output null.
- The Arithmetic module exports the output of two functions, add and sub.  Add takes in an airty of two parameters, both numbers and returns their sum.  Sub, also takes in an airty of two numbers and returns their difference.  If the parameters do not resolve to numbers then the function should return null.

## Architecture
